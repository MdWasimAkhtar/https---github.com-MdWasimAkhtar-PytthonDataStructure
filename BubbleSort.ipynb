    "Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order.

Similarly, all unsorted cards are taken and put in their exact place.\n",

Although it is simple to use, it is not appropriate for large data sets as the time complexity of insertion sort in the average case and worst case is O(n2), where n is the number of items.
